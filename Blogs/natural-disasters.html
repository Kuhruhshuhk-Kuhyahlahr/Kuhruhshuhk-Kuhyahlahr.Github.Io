	<p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>Turkey is prone to several types of natural disasters due to its complex geology and varied climate. The most significant threats come from earthquakes, but the country also experiences others.</span></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>Here is a breakdown of the major natural disasters in Turkey:</span></p><h3><strong><span>1. Earthquakes (The Most Devastating Threat)</span></strong></h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>Turkey is one of the world's most seismically active countries.</span></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Why:</span></strong><span> It sits on several major fault lines, most notably the </span><strong><span>North Anatolian Fault (NAF)</span></strong><span> (running east-west near Istanbul and the Black Sea) and the </span><strong><span>East Anatolian Fault (EAF)</span></strong><span> (in southeastern Turkey).</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Recent Major Events:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>February 2023:</span></strong><span> The </span><strong><span>Kahramanmaraş Earthquake Sequence</span></strong><span> (7.8 and 7.5 magnitude) was the deadliest in modern Turkish history, affecting 11 provinces in the south, causing over 50,000 deaths and immense destruction.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>1999 İzmit Earthquake:</span></strong><span> A 7.6 magnitude quake on the NAF near Istanbul caused ~17,000 deaths.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Constant Risk:</span></strong><span> Seismologists warn of a high probability of a major earthquake in the </span><strong><span>Sea of Marmara near Istanbul</span></strong><span> in the coming decades, which would have catastrophic consequences due to the city's dense population.</span></p></li></ul><h3><strong><span>2. Landslides</span></strong></h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>Earthquakes are a primary trigger, but landslides also occur due to:</span></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Geology:</span></strong><span> Steep slopes with loose rock and soil.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Heavy Rainfall:</span></strong><span> Especially in the Black Sea region (which receives the highest precipitation).</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Deforestation and Unplanned Construction:</span></strong><span> These human activities significantly increase susceptibility.</span></p></li></ul><h3><strong><span>3. Floods</span></strong></h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>Flash floods and river floods are common and often deadly.</span></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Black Sea Region:</span></strong><span> Most frequent, due to intense rainfall and mountainous terrain.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Mediterranean Coast:</span></strong><span> Also susceptible to sudden, heavy storms.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Urban Flooding:</span></strong><span> In major cities like Istanbul, inadequate drainage and concrete cover can turn heavy rain into dangerous urban floods.</span></p></li></ul><h3><strong><span>4. Wildfires</span></strong></h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>A major threat during the hot, dry summer months, particularly along the </span><strong><span>Aegean and Mediterranean coasts</span></strong><span>.</span></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Climate Change:</span></strong><span> Increasing the frequency, intensity, and length of the fire season.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Notable Events:</span></strong><span> The summer of </span><strong><span>2021</span></strong><span> saw devastating fires in Antalya, Muğla (around Marmaris), and other provinces, destroying large forest areas and villages.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Human Cause:</span></strong><span> Many fires are started by negligence (e.g., discarded trash, faulty power lines) or in rare cases, arson.</span></p></li></ul><h3><strong><span>5. Avalanches</span></strong></h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>Occur in the </span><strong><span>eastern and northeastern mountainous regions</span></strong><span> during winter.</span></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>High Risk Areas:</span></strong><span> The provinces along the Eastern Black Sea and Eastern Anatolia mountains.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Causes:</span></strong><span> Heavy snowfall, steep slopes, and sometimes triggered by seismic activity or loud noises.</span></p></li></ul><h3><strong><span>6. Drought</span></strong></h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>A growing and severe threat, particularly in the </span><strong><span>central Anatolian plateau</span></strong><span>.</span></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Climate Change:</span></strong><span> Leading to decreasing precipitation, shrinking water resources (like Lake Van and Lake Tuz), and lower agricultural yields.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Impact:</span></strong><span> Has profound effects on agriculture, water supply for major cities, and ecosystems.</span></p></li></ul><h3><strong><span>Key Government and Response Systems:</span></strong></h3><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD):</span></strong><span> The main government body responsible for disaster management, from preparedness to response and recovery.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Building Codes:</span></strong><span> After the 1999 earthquake, seismic building codes were significantly strengthened, but </span><strong><span>poor enforcement and illegal construction</span></strong><span> remain critical problems, as tragically evidenced in the 2023 earthquakes.</span></p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong><span>Early Warning Systems:</span></strong><span> Being developed, particularly for earthquakes and floods.</span></p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><span>In summary, </span><strong><span>earthquakes pose the single greatest natural disaster risk</span></strong><span> in Turkey, but the country faces a multi-hazard environment where </span><strong><span>climate-change intensified events</span></strong><span> like wildfires, floods, and drought are becoming increasingly severe. The intersection of high natural hazards with dense urban populations and vulnerabilities in construction and infrastructure defines Turkey's disaster risk landscape.</span></p>
